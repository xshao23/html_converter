## Part I  

**I thought once how Theocritus had sung**   
~~Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years~~,  
*Who each one in a gracious hand appears*  
To bear a gift for mortals, ==*old or young*==:  
And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,  
I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,  
***The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,***  

Those of my own life, who by turns had flung  
A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,  
So weeping, how a *mystic Shape* did move  
***B~e~hind m^e^***, and drew me backward by the hair;  
And a voice said in mastery, while I strove, --  
`Guess now who holds thee?` -- `Death.` I said. But, there  
The silver answer rang, -- **`Not Death, but love.`**

### Number 33

- Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear  
- The name I used to run at, when a child,  
  - From innocent play, and leave the cowslips piled,  
  - To glance up in some face that proved me dear    
  

+ With the look of its eyes. I miss the clear
+ Fond voices, which, being drawn and reconciled
+ Into the music of Heaven's undefiled,
+ Call me no longer. Silence on the bier,
  

* While I call God...call God!—So let thy mouth
* Be heir to those who are now exanimate:  
  
+ Gather the north flowers to complete the south,
+ And catch the early love up in the late!
  * Yes, call me by that name,—and I, in truth,
    - With the same heart, will answer, and not wait.[3]
