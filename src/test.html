<html><body><h1>Sonnets from the Portuguese  </h1><hr/><h2>Part I  </h2><p>I thought once how Theocritus had sung<br/>
Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,<br/>
Who each one in a gracious hand appears<br/>
To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:<br/>
And, <strong>as I mused it in his antique tongue</strong>,<br/>
I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,<br/>
<strong><em>The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,</em></strong>  </p><p>Those of my own life, who by turns had flung<br/>
A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,<br/>
So weeping, how a <em>mystic Shape</em> did move<br/>
Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;<br/>
And a voice said in mastery, while I strove, --<br/>
<code>Guess now who holds thee?</code> -- <code>Death.</code> I said. But, there<br/>
The silver answer rang, -- <strong><code>Not Death, but love.</code></strong>  </p><hr/><h2>Author</h2><p>The author is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning" title="A brief Introduction to Browning">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>, an English poet of the Victorian era.</p><p><img alt="Picture of her: " src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning.jpg" title="Elizabeth Barrett Browning"/></p><hr/><h3>Number 33</h3><ol><li><p>Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear<br/></p></li><li><p>The name I used to run at, when a child,<br/></p></li></ol><ul><li><p>From innocent play, and leave the cowslips piled,<br/></p></li><li><p>To glance up in some face that proved me dear    </p></li></ul><p>1.
